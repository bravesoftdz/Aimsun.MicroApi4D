# Aimsun-MicroApi
Aimsun MicroApi in Object Pascal

This is Aimsun MicroApi ported to Object Pascal. No need sticking to Aimsun's original poorly designed and full-of-typos C-style APIs. Use the elegant Pascal to have at least some fun if you are (unfortunately) stuck with Aimsun.

Supports up to the latest Aimsun version 8.4.
