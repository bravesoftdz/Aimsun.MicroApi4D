# Aimsun-MicroApi
Aimsun MicroApi in Object Pascal - Aimsun MicroApi ported to Object Pascal. 

Aimsun's official C-style MicroAPIs are poorly designed and bloated. Yes, I really mean poorly designed unless you consider passing around large C structs by value and defining funcions with 15+ parameters are a good style. Not to mention the inconsistent naming conventions, typos and bad taste of function signitures.  All indicating ad-hoc additions over the years lacking a systematic design upfront while missing code quality QA/QC alongside. 

Use the elegant Pascal to have at least some relief and fun if you are (unfortunately) stuck with Aimsun. Supports up to the latest Aimsun version 8.4.
